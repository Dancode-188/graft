## ðŸ”„ In Progress / TODO

### Performance Optimization
- [x] **Large Repository Testing** - Verify 1000+ commits render smoothly
  - [x] Profile rendering time

  - [x] Memoize edge path computation

- [x] **Virtual Scrolling Enhancement**
  - [x] Virtualization working on graph panel
  - [x] Render only visible commits on SVG
  - [x] Lazy-load branch information

### Git Tag Support
- [x] **Tag Data Structure** - Rust backend
  - [x] Fetch tags from git repo
  - [x] Map tags to commits
  - [x] Include tag type (annotated vs lightweight)
  - [x] Include tag metadata

- [x] **Tag Display** - Graph visualization
