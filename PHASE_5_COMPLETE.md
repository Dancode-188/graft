# Phase 5: Branching - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date:** October 30, 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive branch management functionality with a beautiful UI and robust Rust backend.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Backend Commands (Rust)
All 5 backend commands implemented in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`:

1. **`get_branches`** ✅
   - Lists all local and remote branches
   - Returns metadata: commit hash, message, date, upstream tracking
   - Properly sorts branches (current first, then local, then remote)
   - Handles edge cases (detached HEAD, no branches)

2. **`create_branch`** ✅
   - Creates branches from HEAD or specific commit/branch
   - Validates branch names (no empty, no "..", no leading/trailing "/")
   - Checks if branch already exists
   - Optional automatic checkout after creation
   - Proper error messages for all failure cases

3. **`switch_branch`** ✅
   - Switches to any local branch
   - **Safety check**: Prevents switching with uncommitted changes
   - Updates working directory and HEAD
   - Clear error messages guide users

4. **`delete_branch`** ✅
   - Deletes local branches with safety checks
   - **Cannot delete current branch** (must switch first)
   - **Checks if branch is merged** (prevents accidental data loss)
   - Force option for unmerged branches
   - Helpful error messages

5. **`rename_branch`** ✅
   - Renames any local branch
   - Validates new name (same rules as create)
   - Checks if new name already exists
   - Works on current or non-current branches

### Frontend Components

#### BranchSidebar (`src/components/BranchSidebar.tsx`)
Beautiful, functional sidebar with:

**Features:**
- Displays all branches (local and remote)
- Current branch highlighted with star (★) and graft-green color
- Search/filter branches by name
- Collapsible remote branches section
- Context menu (right-click) for actions
- Keyboard navigation ready
- Real-time updates after branch operations

**UI Elements:**
- Search input at top
- Local branches section (always visible)
- Remote branches section (collapsible)
- Each branch shows:
  - Name with icon (★ for current, 🌿 for local, 🌐 for remote)
  - Last commit message (truncated)
  - Relative time (e.g., "2 days ago")
- "New Branch" button at bottom
- Refresh button

**Interactions:**
- Click branch → Switch to it (with safety checks)
- Right-click branch → Context menu (Rename, Delete)
- Hover effects for better UX
- Loading states during operations

**Context Menu:**
- Switch to branch (if not current)
- Rename branch
- Delete branch (if not current)

#### BranchModal (`src/components/BranchModal.tsx`)
Modal dialog for branch operations:

**Modes:**
1. **Create Mode**
   - Branch name input with validation
   - Start point selector (HEAD, commit hash, or branch name)
   - "Checkout after creation" checkbox (default: true)
   - Real-time validation feedback

2. **Rename Mode**
   - Shows current name (read-only)
   - New name input with validation
   - Prevents invalid names

3. **Delete Mode**
   - Warning message (red theme)
   - "This action cannot be undone" notice
   - Force delete checkbox for unmerged branches
   - Destructive action styling (red button)

**Features:**
- Escape key to close
- Enter key to submit
- Loading states with spinners
- Error display panel
- Proper form validation
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, focus management)

### App Integration

#### In `src/App.tsx`:

**New State:**
```typescript
const [showBranchSidebar, setShowBranchSidebar] = useState(true);
const [branchModalOpen, setBranchModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [branchModalMode, setBranchModalMode] = useState<'create' | 'rename' | 'delete'>('create');
const [selectedBranch, setSelectedBranch] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` → Toggle branch sidebar
- `Cmd+N` / `Ctrl+N` → Create new branch

**Handlers:**
```typescript
// Refresh UI after branch operations
const handleBranchChange = async () => {
  // Refreshes repo info (updates current branch)
  // Reloads commit list
  // Deselects current commit
};

// Opens modal for branch actions
const handleBranchAction = (action, branchName?) => {
  // Sets modal mode (create/rename/delete)
  // Sets selected branch (for rename/delete)
  // Opens modal
};
```

**Layout Update:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header (Graft v0.3.0)                       │
├───────────┬─────────────┬───────────────────┤
│           │             │                   │
│ Branches  │  Commits    │ Details/Staging   │
│ Sidebar   │  + Graph    │                   │
│ (240px)   │             │                   │
│           │             │                   │
└───────────┴─────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

- [ ] Try invalid names (spaces, "..", empty)
- [ ] Try creating existing branch (should fail)
- [ ] Create with checkout enabled
- [ ] Create without checkout

**Branch Switching:**
- [ ] Switch between branches
- [ ] Try switching with uncommitted changes (should warn)
- [ ] Verify commit list updates after switch
- [ ] Verify current branch indicator updates
- [ ] Verify repo info in header updates

**Branch Deletion:**

- [ ] Try invalid new names
- [ ] Try renaming to existing name (should fail)
- [ ] Verify name updates in sidebar

**UI/UX:**
