# Phase 7: Interactive Rebase - Testing Guide

**Goal**: Thoroughly test all interactive rebase features to ensure they work flawlessly

**Status**: 🧪 Ready for Testing  
**Last Updated**: October 30, 2025

---

## 🎯 Testing Overview

Phase 7 implements **visual, drag-and-drop interactive rebase** - one of the most complex and powerful Git operations. This guide will walk you through testing all features systematically.

### What We're Testing:
1. ✅ **Backend Commands** (7 Rust functions)
2. ✅ **UI Components** (5 React modals)
3. ✅ **Drag-and-Drop** (reordering commits)
4. ✅ **Actions** (pick, squash, fixup, drop, reword)
5. ✅ **Conflict Handling** (pause, resolve, continue)
6. ✅ **Safety Features** (validation, abort, warnings)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before testing, you need a Git repository with **multiple commits** that you can safely rebase. 

### Option 1: Use the Graft Repository Itself ✅ (Recommended)
The graft repo has plenty of commits - perfect for testing!

### Option 2: Create a Test Repository
If you want a clean sandbox:

```bash
# Create test repo
mkdir C:\Users\user\test-rebase
cd C:\Users\user\test-rebase
git init

# Create several commits
echo "First" > file1.txt
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "feat: First commit"

echo "Second" > file2.txt
git add file2.txt
git commit -m "feat: Second commit"

echo "Third" > file3.txt
git add file3.txt
git commit -m "WIP: Third commit (will drop)"

echo "Fourth" > file4.txt
git add file4.txt
git commit -m "feat: Fourth commit"

echo "Fixup" >> file4.txt
git add file4.txt
git commit -m "fixup: Fix typo in fourth"

echo "Fifth" > file5.txt
git add file5.txt
git commit -m "feat: Fifth commit"
```

Now you have 6 commits to play with!

## 🧪 Test Plan

### Test 1: Opening Interactive Rebase Modal ✅

**Goal**: Verify the rebase modal opens correctly

**Steps**:
1. Open Graft (`npm run dev`)
2. Open a repository (graft or your test repo)
3. View commit history
4. **Right-click any commit** (not the most recent one)
5. Look for "Interactive Rebase from Here..." option

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Context menu appears on right-click
- ✅ "Interactive Rebase from Here..." option is visible
- ✅ Clicking it opens the Interactive Rebase Modal
- ✅ Modal shows commits from the clicked commit to HEAD
