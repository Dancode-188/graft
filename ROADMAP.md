## Development Principles

### Build → Measure → Learn
- Release weekly alphas
- Get feedback early
- Iterate based on real usage
- Don't build features nobody wants

### Dogfooding
- Use Graft to build Graft
- If something is annoying us, fix it
- If we wouldn't use it, users won't either

### Focus
- Do fewer things, do them better
- Say no to feature requests that don't fit vision
- Perfect the 80% use case first
- Advanced features come later
