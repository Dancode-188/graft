🎉 After 10 development phases, I'm excited to announce Graft v1.0.0!

It's a fast, beautiful, keyboard-first Git GUI that's completely free and open source.

Let me show you why it's better than commercial alternatives 👇

🚀 Performance that matters:

• Native Tauri + Rust (not Electron)
• <1 second startup
• Smooth with 10,000+ commits
• Fast search (<100ms)
• Only ~80MB RAM

Compare that to GitKraken's 3s startup and 500MB+ memory usage.
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
⌨️ Best keyboard experience of any Git GUI:

• Command palette (Cmd+K) - 30+ commands
• Quick search (Cmd+P) - Find anything instantly
• 20+ keyboard shortcuts
• Never touch your mouse 😎

Power users will love this.
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
🎨 Complete theme system:

• Professional dark theme
• Clean light theme
• Instant switching (<100ms)
• 100% coverage (34 components)
• Auto-follows system preference

Both themes are gorgeous and accessible (WCAG AA).
```

**Tweet 5/5:**

💎 The kicker? It's completely FREE.

No $99/year subscriptions (GitKraken)
No $99 licenses (Tower, Sublime Merge)
Just MIT licensed open source
