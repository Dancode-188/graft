# 🎉 Phase 3: Staging & Commits - COMPLETE!

We've successfully implemented the **complete staging and commit workflow** for Graft!

---

## ✅ What We Built Today

### Backend (Rust)
- ✅ `get_working_directory_status()` - List staged/unstaged files
- ✅ `stage_files()` - Add files to staging area
- ✅ `unstage_files()` - Remove files from staging
- ✅ `create_commit()` - Create commits with validation

### Frontend (React)
- ✅ **StagingArea** - Beautiful split-pane interface
- ✅ **FileListItem** - Color-coded status badges
- ✅ **CommitMessageInput** - Multi-line with shortcuts
- ✅ **Tabbed Panel** - Staging | Details views

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ One-click stage/unstage
- ✅ Visual file status indicators
- ✅ Commit message validation
- ✅ Ctrl/Cmd+Enter keyboard shortcut
- ✅ Auto-refresh after commit
- ✅ Tab switching between staging and details

---

## 🎯 The Workflow (Try It!)

```
1. Open Graft → Opens with Staging panel visible
2. See your changes → Unstaged files listed
3. Click files → Stage them (they move down)
4. Write message → Type in commit box
5. Press Ctrl/Cmd+Enter → Commit created!
6. Watch → New commit appears in graph instantly!
```

---

## 🚀 How to Test

### Start the App
```bash
cd C:\Users\user\graft
npm run dev
```

### Make Some Changes
```bash
# In the graft repo, edit a file
echo "Test change" >> README.md

# Or create a new file
echo "New feature" > test.txt
```

### Then in Graft:
1. **Open the graft repository** (C:\Users\user\graft)
2. **See your changes** in the Staging panel
3. **Click files** to stage them
4. **Write a commit message** 
5. **Press Ctrl+Enter** or click "Commit"
6. **Watch magic happen!** ✨
