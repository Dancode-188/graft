## 🎓 What We Learned

### Git2-rs Rebase API
The rebase implementation was the most challenging part. We learned:
- Rebase requires iterating through operations
- Must check for conflicts after each commit
- Aborting rebase leaves repo in clean state
- Signature required for rebase commits

### Borrow Checker
Rust's ownership system taught us to:
- Calculate values before moving into structs
- Use cloning strategically for Arc<Mutex<T>>
- Think about ownership in error handling

### UX for Destructive Operations
The 2-second hold button proved that:
- Confirmation dialogs can be annoying
- Physical interaction builds confidence
- Visual progress provides feedback
- Users appreciate safety without friction

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Not in v0.5.0 Scope
- **HTTPS with PAT**: SSH works great, PAT deferred to future
- **Conflict Resolution UI**: Can use text editor (Phase 7+)
- **Multiple Remotes**: Uses 'origin' by default
- **Real-time Progress**: Generic progress bar (git2 limitation)

These are documented and will be addressed in future releases.

Next release will bring:
- Visual drag-and-drop commit reordering
- Pick/squash/fixup/edit/drop operations
