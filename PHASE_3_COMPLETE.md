# Phase 3: Staging & Commits - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Commit:** f0b55e5

---

## 🎉 What We Built

Phase 3 brings **full Git staging and commit functionality** to Graft, allowing you to stage files, write commits, and see them appear instantly in the commit history.

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### Backend (Rust - `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)

#### New Tauri Commands
1. **`get_working_directory_status(path: String)`**
   - Returns staged and unstaged files
   - Detects file status: modified, added, deleted, renamed, conflicted
   - Separates files by staging state

2. **`stage_files(path: String, file_paths: Vec<String>)`**
   - Adds files to Git staging area
   - Supports multiple files at once
   - Updates Git index

3. **`unstage_files(path: String, file_paths: Vec<String>)`**
   - Removes files from staging area
   - Resets to HEAD version (for modified files)
   - Removes from index (for new files)
   - Handles both scenarios correctly

4. **`create_commit(path: String, message: String)`**
   - Creates a Git commit with staged files
   - Validates commit message is not empty
   - Returns commit hash on success
   - Uses repository signature for author info

#### New Data Types
```rust
WorkingDirectoryFile {
    path: String,
    status: String,
    is_staged: bool,
}

WorkingDirectoryStatus {
    staged: Vec<WorkingDirectoryFile>,
    unstaged: Vec<WorkingDirectoryFile>,
}

CommitResult {
    success: bool,
    commit_hash: String,
    message: String,
}
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

#### New Components

**1. StagingArea.tsx** - Main Staging Interface
- Split-pane layout: Unstaged (top) | Staged (bottom)
- Auto-loads working directory status on mount
- Refresh button to reload status
- Stage/unstage files with single click
- Commit message input with validation
- Commit button (only enabled when files are staged)
- Automatic history refresh after commit
- Error display for failed operations

**2. FileListItem.tsx** - Individual File Display
- Status badge with color coding:
  - **M** (Modified) - Blue
  - **A** (Added) - Green
  - **D** (Deleted) - Red
  - **R** (Renamed) - Yellow
  - **C** (Conflicted) - Orange
- File path display with monospace font
- Click to stage/unstage (with arrow hint)
- Hover effects for better UX

**3. CommitMessageInput.tsx** - Commit Message Editor
- Multi-line textarea with resize support
- Character counter
- Keyboard shortcut display (Ctrl/Cmd+Enter)
- Validation indicator for empty messages
- Auto-focus management
- Platform-specific shortcut detection (Mac vs Windows/Linux)

#### UI Integration (`src/App.tsx`)

**Tabbed Right Panel**
- Two tabs: **📝 Staging** | **🔍 Details**
- Defaults to Staging panel when repo opens
- Auto-switches to Details when commit is selected
- Responsive tab highlighting with Graft brand colors
- Smooth transitions between views

**Callback Wiring**
- `handleCommitCreated()` - Refreshes commit history after commit
- `handleSelectCommit()` - Switches to details panel
- Automatic commit deselection after refresh

**Status Bar Update**
- Changed from "Phase 2: Git Graph Visualization 🌳"
- To "Phase 3: Staging & Commits ✏️"

## 🎨 User Experience

### Workflow
1. **Open Repository** - Graft opens with Staging panel visible
2. **See Changes** - Unstaged and staged files are listed
3. **Stage Files** - Click files in "Unstaged Changes" to move them to "Staged Changes"
4. **Unstage Files** - Click files in "Staged Changes" to move them back
5. **Write Message** - Type commit message in the text area
6. **Commit** - Click commit button or press Ctrl/Cmd+Enter
7. **History Updates** - New commit appears immediately in the commit graph

### Visual Design
- Clean split-pane layout with clear labels
- Color-coded file status badges
- Smooth hover transitions
- Disabled states for invalid actions
- Loading indicators during operations
- Error messages with helpful context

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** - Create commit (when in commit message field)
- **Click file** - Stage/unstage
- Works seamlessly with existing shortcuts (Cmd+O, Cmd+F, arrows)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Operations
- [ ] Open a Git repository with uncommitted changes
- [ ] Verify unstaged files appear in "Unstaged Changes" section
- [ ] Click a file to stage it
- [ ] Verify file moves to "Staged Changes" section
- [ ] Click a staged file to unstage it
- [ ] Verify file moves back to "Unstaged Changes"

### Commit Creation
- [ ] Stage at least one file
- [ ] Type a commit message
- [ ] Verify character counter updates
- [ ] Click "Commit" button
- [ ] Verify commit appears at the top of the commit history
- [ ] Verify staging area clears after commit
- [ ] Click on the new commit to view its details

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Try to commit with no files staged (should be disabled)
- [ ] Try to commit with empty message (should show validation error)
- [ ] Stage multiple files at once (click several files)
- [ ] Test with different file statuses (modified, added, deleted)
- [ ] Test refresh button to reload status
- [ ] Switch between Staging and Details tabs

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] Focus commit message input
- [ ] Press Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to commit
- [ ] Verify commit is created
- [ ] Verify shortcut key displays correctly (⌘ on Mac, Ctrl on Windows/Linux)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test with repository in detached HEAD state
- [ ] Test with merge conflicts (if possible)
- [ ] Test staging a deleted file
- [ ] Test unstaging a new file
