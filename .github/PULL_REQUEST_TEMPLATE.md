## PR Guidelines Checklist

<!-- Please verify ALL of these before submitting -->

- [ ] **PR is focused** - This PR addresses ONE specific issue/feature (not multiple unrelated changes)
- [ ] **Small size** - This PR has fewer than 10 commits and changes fewer than 500 lines of code
- [ ] **No core file changes without discussion** - I have NOT modified `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `package.json`, or `README.md` without prior discussion in an issue
- [ ] **Issue discussion** - For new features or major changes, I opened an issue first and got approval
- [ ] **Clean commit history** - Commits are squashed/rebased, and each has a clear message
- [ ] **No package-lock.json deletion** - I have NOT deleted `package-lock.json` (this breaks dependency reproducibility)
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - If I changed behavior, I updated relevant documentation
- [ ] **Tests pass** - All existing tests still pass with my changes

## Code Quality Checklist

<!-- Mark completed items with an 'x' -->

- [ ] My code follows the project's code style
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings or errors
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **One feature per PR** - Don't combine multiple unrelated changes
2. **Discuss first** - Open an issue before working on major features
3. **Keep it small** - Smaller PRs are easier to review and merge
4. **Don't modify core files** - `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `package.json` require discussion first
5. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure everything works before submitting

**By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the MIT license.**
