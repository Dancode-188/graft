## 🔮 What's NOT Included (Post-MVP)

These features were intentionally deferred to future phases:

- ❌ Edit action (pause to amend commit) - Complex, low priority
- ❌ In-app conflict resolution - External tools work well
- ❌ Visual diff of rebase preview - Nice-to-have
- ❌ Undo last rebase - Git limitation
- ❌ Rebase templates/presets - Post-MVP
- ❌ Keyboard-only mode - Phase 9
- ❌ Rebase onto remote - Can do, not focus
- ❌ Multi-branch rebase - Advanced feature
