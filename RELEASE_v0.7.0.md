## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
7 new Tauri commands for rebase operations:
- `get_rebase_commits` - Fetch commits in rebase range
- `validate_rebase_order` - Validate instruction sequence
- `start_rebase` - Execute rebase with instructions
- `get_rebase_status` - Check current rebase state
- `continue_rebase` - Resume after conflict resolution
- `abort_rebase` - Safely cancel rebase
- `check_rebase_in_progress` - Detect existing rebase

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
5 new React components:
- `InteractiveRebaseModal` - Main configuration interface
- `RebasePreviewModal` - Preview changes before execution
- `RebaseProgressModal` - Progress tracking during rebase
- `RebaseConflictModal` - Conflict resolution interface
- `RebaseCommitItem` - Commit row with drag-and-drop

### Performance
- Smooth drag-and-drop with HTML5 API
- Real-time validation with no lag
- Efficient state management
- Optimized rendering with React.memo

## 🏆 What This Means

### Competitive Edge
Graft now has one of the best interactive rebase experiences of any Git client:
- Better than GitKraken (free vs paid, native vs Electron)
- Better than SourceTree (actually works, doesn't crash)
- Better than GitHub Desktop (way more powerful)
- Better than command line (visual, safe, intuitive)

### Why It Matters
Interactive rebase is the feature that separates casual Git users from power users. With Graft, anyone can safely reorganize their Git history without fear or confusion.

---

## 🎯 Known Limitations

Intentionally deferred to keep scope focused:
- Reword action doesn't pause for editing yet (planned for Phase 9)
- Edit action not yet implemented (planned for Phase 9)
- Keyboard shortcuts for rebase not yet added (planned for Phase 9)
- Multi-select commits not available (planned for Phase 10)

These don't affect core functionality - v0.7.0 is production-ready!

## 🚀 What's Next?

### Phase 8: Stash Management (v0.8.0)
Coming soon:
- Create stashes with messages
- List and preview stashes
- Apply/pop/drop stashes
- Search stashes
- Clean UI for stash management
